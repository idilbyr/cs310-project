# cs310-project
This project aims to create a mobile application that helps people find watches based on their style. The app will mainly display to the user some random or filtered watches from every watch style, and the user will like each one or not, so that the user will see similar watches and find a good product that they want.

## The Problem
The aim of our project is to create a refined platform for users solely on watches. Unlike today's shopping applications, an easy layout and on-topic watch advertisement will keep the audience up to date. Suggesting only one type of product makes generating similar content much more precise and useful as an algorithm. Our target audience can be anyone who has a genuine interest in watches. Although from the statistics, it is clear to pinpoint that middle-aged men would probably contribute to the target audience the most. Our project wants to resolve the issue where users get junk advertisements while using shopping applications and miss good deals or limited edition products. Moreover, the simplicity of this application enables future projects that can be adapted to different types of products as well.
## Features
### Core Features 
The app will have the following core features:
- Swapping images
- Notification about limited products
- Preference section
-  Search bar
-  Filters
### Additional Features
- Offering only available products in your country
## Platform
We are using Android Studio with the Flutter tool.
## Data
The data will be extracted from the websites specified for selling watches. As a future project, the scope of the websites can be extended to any website where any watch can be sold.
## Challenges
One of the main challenges would be the rating algorithm and how to get and classify the watches. In order to achieve that, we need to train a neural network based on user-dependent choices. Additionally, extracting watch information from the public websites requires special attention since this bulk data cannot be used without proper cleaning.
